# LRU-Cache-implementation
A DSA project which will strengthen your DSA concepts like hashing and linked list as well as C++ concepts like pointers, STL etc. It is one of the Page Replacement Algorithm. In simple words, LRU caching scheme is to remove the least recently used frame when the cache memory is full and a new page is referenced which is not there in cache memeory from the main memory.

Pre-requisites:

Basics of C++ (including pointers)
Basics knowledge of STL (i have used unordered_map and list here)
Hashing
What a user can do :

Insert data in key-value pair
Get the value of the entered string
Return the most recently used key value pair.
I have also added a lot of comments in between the code for better understanding :) #KEEP LEARNING
